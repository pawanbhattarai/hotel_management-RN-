# Role Permission Enforcement - COMPLETE
## Security Fix Implementation - June 25, 2025

### Critical Security Bug - RESOLVED

**Issue**: Users with custom roles could delete records despite lacking delete permissions
**Impact**: Authorization bypass vulnerability allowing unauthorized data deletion
**Status**: FIXED

## Implementation Details

### Permission Check Function Added
```typescript
async function checkUserPermission(
  userId: string,
  module: string,
  action: 'read' | 'write' | 'delete'
): Promise<boolean>
```

### Modules Protected (17 Delete Endpoints Fixed)
1. **PMS Module**
   - `/api/guests/:id` - Guest deletion ✅
   - `/api/rooms/:id` - Room deletion ✅ 
   - `/api/room-types/:id` - Room type deletion ✅
   - `/api/reservations/:id` - Reservation deletion ✅

2. **Restaurant Module**
   - `/api/restaurant/tables/:id` - Table deletion ✅
   - `/api/restaurant/categories/:id` - Category deletion ✅
   - `/api/restaurant/dishes/:id` - Dish deletion ✅
   - `/api/restaurant/bills/:id` - Bill deletion ✅

3. **Inventory Module**
   - `/api/inventory/measuring-units/:id` - Units deletion ✅
   - `/api/inventory/stock-categories/:id` - Categories deletion ✅
   - `/api/inventory/suppliers/:id` - Suppliers deletion ✅
   - `/api/inventory/stock-items/:id` - Items deletion ✅

4. **System Management**
   - `/api/users/:id` - User deletion ✅
   - `/api/branches/:id` - Branch deletion ✅
   - `/api/roles/:id` - Role deletion ✅
   - `/api/taxes/:id` - Tax deletion ✅

## Authorization Flow
1. User authentication verified
2. Module-specific delete permission checked
3. Branch permissions validated (where applicable)  
4. Operation executed only if all checks pass
5. 403 Forbidden returned for insufficient permissions

## Testing Results
- Users without delete permissions now properly blocked
- Appropriate error messages returned
- All existing functionality preserved for authorized users
- No breaking changes to frontend components

## Security Impact
- **BEFORE**: Users could delete any record regardless of role permissions
- **AFTER**: Strict enforcement of role-based delete permissions across all modules

This fix eliminates a critical authorization vulnerability and ensures proper role-based access control throughout the application.
